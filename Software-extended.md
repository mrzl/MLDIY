## [neural-storyteller](https://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller) ##

neural-storyteller is a recurrent neural network that generates little stories about images. This repository contains code for generating stories with your own images, as well as instructions for training new models.

### The whole approach contains 4 components: ###

- skip-thought vectors
- image-sentence embeddings
- conditional neural language models
- style shifting (described in this project)

### Dependencies ###
This code is written in python. To use it you will need:
- Python 2.7
- A recent version of NumPy and SciPy
- Lasagne
- A version of Theano that Lasagne supports
