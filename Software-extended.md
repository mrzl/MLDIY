## [neural-storyteller](https://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller) ##

neural-storyteller is a recurrent neural network that generates little stories about images. This repository contains code for generating stories with your own images, as well as instructions for training new models.

### The whole approach contains 4 components: ###

- skip-thought vectors
- image-sentence embeddings
- conditional neural language models
- style shifting (described in this project)

### Dependencies ###
This code is written in python. To use it you will need:
- Python 2.7
- A recent version of NumPy and SciPy
- Lasagne
- A version of Theano that Lasagne supports

### Models? ###

## [Google deepdream](https://github.com/google/deepdream)
This repository contains IPython Notebook with sample code, complementing Google Research blog post about Neural Network art. See original gallery for more examples.

Dependencies
This notebook is designed to have as few dependencies as possible:
- Standard Python scientific stack: NumPy, SciPy, PIL, IPython. Those libraries can also be installed as a part of one of the scientific - packages for Python, such as Anaconda or Canopy.
- Caffe deep learning framework
- Google protobuf library that is used for Caffe model manipulation.

### Model ###
not required. Just [start Jupyter](https://github.com/mrzl/MLDIY/wiki/Running-Jupyter-notebooks-remotely) open the browser and go.
